  How to use -------------------------------------------------------------

   *  wcopy is a normal robot for download a web site 
      without problems.
      First use is :
    
          ./wcopy.exe -verbose -url www.cool.com
    
      That make a mirror in the current directory, of web pages at 
      'www.cool.com' :

             www.cool.com/.
             www.cool.com/..
             www.cool.com/index.html
             ...

   *  If you are a litte crazy (:-O) you can use :
    
          ./wcopy.exe -url www.cool.com -global
    
      By default, wcopy only download urls from www.cool.com;
      with '-global' wcopy will NOT stop in this machine.
      (Not for my hard disk ;->)

   *  If you press Ctrl-C or reboot you computer or ... *see morphy laws* 
      NO PROBLEM, you can continue downloading without loss what 
      you got. Use for recover :

          ./wcopy.exe -verbose -resume resume.www.cool.com

      in 'resume.<site>', wcopy save all necesary to recover
      gracelly. You can edit this file, but be very, very carefully.

   *  It is easy limit amount of web to download :
      you can limit amount of byte you want to download with :

          ./wcopy.exe -url www.mysite.web -verbose -maxbytes 1000000

      Limit is set at one Megabyte (1000000). 
      Also you can limit the number of urls :

          ./wcopy.exe -url www.mysite.web -verbose -maxurls 1000

   *  Need speed ?, wcopy support proxy :

          ./wcopy.exe -url www.mysite.web -verbose -proxy myproxy.web:8080

      In this version (060), when proxy report 'error 400 Cache error...'
      wcopy DO NOT try connect directly, simply skip url 
      (or try again download url, if you use '-rentry')

   *  why are you still reading ??!!

          ./wcopy.exe -help

      See other options, learn by yourself using it...
