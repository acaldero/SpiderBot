  ***  SpiderBot is TEMPORAL SOLUTION :

      Some anonymous ftp, have 'mirrors' of web sites, that you can
      browse offline.

      Also will see 'webcasting'. Your site (a computer where url are
      almost 90% local to computer) have a file that is a database. A
      database of all contents, last modified time, and all information
      that a browse can get, and checking with files in your cache it
      know url needs update.

      There are some magazine, with CD-ROM's (or DVD's) where you can
      find mirror of famous web sites. 

      Do you see TELETEXT ? Digital-TV will offer channels where Teletext
      are web pages, you see a site at 16:00 and next at 16:10 ...

      In a few months, we will see 'webfs' (web file systems) that are
      like 'nfs', but connectionless. You can mount you favorite
      site in a directory, and Operating System let you access files
      like you are use this robot. It use cache, and will update files
      only if necesary. References to others places will be automount
      at use.

      If you see, there are may ways to get your information WITHOUT
      use Internet. Use Internet need money to connect you, 
      perhaps is posible get your information faster and 
      cheaper... (ChEaPeR ??? ;->)
